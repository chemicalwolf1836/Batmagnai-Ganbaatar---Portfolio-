## Featured Tool: PromptKit

PromptKit is a front-end workflow tool embedded in this site.  
It converts rough notes into structured project summaries using a clean UI and client-side state management.

### What it does
- Turns rough notes into a structured output (Problem → Actions → Result → Tools)
- Supports draft persistence and recovery via localStorage
- Includes a clear-draft reset flow for predictable state handling
- Uses DOM event handling to manage user interactions

### Tech used
- HTML / CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- localStorage (draft persistence)

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – homepage
- `projects.html` – projects listing
- `promptkit.html` – PromptKit tool page (if separate)
- `styles.css` – site styling
- `script.js` – interactivity + PromptKit logic

## Notes
This site is part of my transition into front-end development and AI workflow systems.  
I focus on clean structure, usability, and practical tooling.
